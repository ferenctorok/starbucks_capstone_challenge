    "In the data exploration notebook we have seen that there are two types of profile data points. One in which all the fields are complete and another in which gender, income and also age data are missing. The number of the latter datapoints is 2175 compared to the number of all the data points 17000. These datapoints could be ommited and still many valid training points would remain. However The people who refuse to give the app their personal data could also be viewed as a special group and hence it is worth it to also keep these points in the data set. \n",
